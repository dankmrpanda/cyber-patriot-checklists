# CyberPatriot XII-XIV Linux Hardening Script
This script (sometimes aggressively) secures Linux system & service configuration. All user input requests should be done upfront. For reference only.
Each functionality / configured service is put in modules located in `mods/`. Enabled modules are executed alphanumerically.

# How to Run
``` sh
# git clone https://github.com/oakrc/cypalinux
# cd cypalinux
# source harden.sh
# harden
```
